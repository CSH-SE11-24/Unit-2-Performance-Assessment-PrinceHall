My project is an invincible themed escape room. You get to pick your name but it dosen't matter what it is. You can either look in the left and right direction and each direction has one hiddenitem that allows you to escape the escape room. You can also check your inventory to look at the items you have and use it to escape the escape room. Each time you investagate a Object the turn will be incremenated by 1 and when it hits five its game over

There is literaly no peformance questions so I'm just gonna answer what i heard in class

If i had more time i would have shifted the item around so the same hiddenitem isn't always stuck on the same object and also added more directions
